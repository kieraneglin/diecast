# Diecast
#### A CLI template creation and management program in Rust

## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk.  Misusing this program can cause you to delete the entire contents of a folder with no way to get it back.  You are warned before any action that would cause an overwrite, but it's up to you to ensure you're in a directory that should have it's contents overwritten.

I offer no warranty on this software and I take no responsibility for any data loss.

**You have been warned**

## Purpose
Diecast provides an easy way to store, recall, and manage project templates.  This is for people who hate wasting time re-writing boilerplate just to get your project started.

## Installation
For now, the only installation method is to compile from source.  

1. Ensure Rust is installed and you're using the latest nightly.
2. Clone this repo and run `cargo install`.

If there's enough interest, I may start including releases and/or release a Homebrew formula.

This might work on Windows, but it's untested.  I'd stay away to avoid potential data loss.

## Usage
There are four main functions within Diecast: `new`, `load`, `delete`, and `list`.  

Templates are stored in `~/.diecast`.  They have no Special Sauceâ„¢ associated with them, so you can create, edit, and delete a template directly from this directory if you so choose.

You can get this info by running `dt` without any args, or with `-h` <sup>(dc was already taken)</sup>.

### New
`dt new <language> <name>`

`new` creates a new template and saves the contents of the current directory to it.

### Load
`dt load <language> <name>`

`load` replaces the contents of the current directory with the specified template.  Again, *this will remove the entire contents of the current directory.  This cannot be undone.*

### Delete
`dt delete <language> <name>`

`delete` removes a template.  *This will destroy a template, removing its files.  This cannot be undone.*

### List
`dt list <language (optional)>`

`list` displays existing templates for a given language.  If no language is specified, all templates for all languages will be shown.
